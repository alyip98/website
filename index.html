    <panel header="Some things to consider when preparing for the talk" expanded="" no-close="">
      <span id="tips-roundA">
<p>Try to follow these steps in this sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Define the <em>intended impact</em> of the talk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to choose an impact that has a <em>do</em> component (e.g., <code>get audience to switch to technology X</code>), not just <em>know</em> and <em>believe</em> components (e.g., <code>tell audience about X</code>). The <em>do</em> component will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.</li>
<li>Frame the intended impact as a <em>call-to-action</em> (CtA).</li></ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find a WIIFY</strong> i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this <em>specific</em> audience at a <em>concrete</em> level.
For example, explaining <code>how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now</code> is better than making a general claim that <code>Foo is a useful technology</code>. Sometimes realizing that ‚Äòthere is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now‚Äô can be a turn off.<br>
If you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Choose some key points that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points.</p>
<ul>
<li>We look for <strong>points, not topics</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>how to use X</code> is a topic while <code>X is easy to use</code> is a point</span>.</li>
      <li>Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, you should be able to say &quot;<code>a</code>; <code>b</code>; <code>c</code>; <em>therefore</em>, <code>CtA</code>&quot;
        <span class="dimmed">e.g., &quot;<code>X is fast</code>; <code>X is free</code>; <code>X is getting popular</code>; <em>therefore</em>, switch to X!&quot;</span></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Decide the talk roadmap (aka agenda, or promise). The may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. Roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather than answers).</p>
        <table class="markbind-table table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Roadmap</th>
              <th>Key points</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>What is X</code><br> <code>Demo of X</code><br> <code>Benefits of X</code></td>
              <td><code>X is fast</code><br> <code>X is free</code><br> <code>X is getting popular</code></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Find a PUNCH.</strong> This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic <span class="dimmed">e.g, if your CtA is <code>switch to X</code>, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Design the slide content.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br> Peers reviewing
            a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can spot those holes.</li>
          <li>Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
            <span class="dimmed">e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:</span>
            <blockquote>
              <p><span class="dimmed">There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.</span></p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>Ensure the last slide has the key points (not a big <code>Thank You</code> or <code>Q&amp;A</code>)</li>
          <li>Limit the content to what you can deliver in <strong>7 minutes</strong> (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&amp;A.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Start the talk with a <em>PUNCH</em>, <em>WIIFY</em>, and the <em>Roadmap</em></strong>. <mark>Avoid the traditional <code>My name is A, my topic is B</code> type start.</mark></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>End the talk with key points and CtA.</strong> It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance</strong>.</p>

              <li>While you have write access to the repo, use your own fork to submit PRs.</li>
              <li>Improving existing content is as valuable as adding new content.</li>
              <li>You can create PRs without corresponding issues.</li>
              <li>Please get the PRs reviewed and approved by a peer before requesting prof's review. You can also request reviews from past contributors of the repo (especially if you are improving an existing topic) but there is no guarantee that they will
                be available to review.</li>
              <li>Aim to get some content merged before mid-semester break.</li>
              <li>If there are others in the class working on the same topic, coordinate among yourselves to avoid duplication of work.</li>
            </ul>

          <li>Writing the 'book chapter':
            <ul>
              <li>Despite using the name ‚Äòbook chapter‚Äô for this deliverable (for the lack of a better term), it is not a normal book. It‚Äôs more of an online repository of learning resources. Therefore, don‚Äôt try to follow the structure of normal text books.</li>
              <li>Related to the above, there‚Äôs no need to use a very formal tone that you see in some text books. Instead, prefer an informal tone you would use in a blog post or an stackoverflow question.</li>
              <li>The book is aimed at typical SE students, but not necessarily SE students in our school.</li>
              <li>Don‚Äôt assume the reader has any prior knowledge of the topic. Just because it is covered in a core module in our school does not mean it will be known to every reader.</li>
              <li>Try to include content that is highly useful and relevant to the reader. The objective is to help the reader, not to demonstrate your expertise. The latter is only a by-product of the former.</li>
              <li>Do not re-invent the wheel by writing a lot of original content. Instead, give a brief high-level view and point to other existing resources that you recommend the reader to use. The value you add is in the form of assembling <strong>a curated list of the best resources into a meaningful sequence, possibly with commentary</strong>,
                NOT creating new content.</li>

        <p>üì¢ Lightning Talks Round B - Part 1</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The break-down of rounds B1-3 will be similar to rounds A1-3 i.e., if you presented in round A1 (week 3), you will present in round B1 (week 7).</li>
          <li>In your slide design and delivery, try to apply the tips covered in week 6 lecture. Some of those points are given in the panel below but you are advised to look at the lecture slides again before you prepare for the talk.</li>
          <li>In addition, aim for a more emphatic application of tips given for round A (see the panel below for a reference)</li>

          <p><strong>Make slides more visual</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Instead of bullet points, use other suitable visual structures <span class="dimmed">e.g., a flow chart</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Instead of text, use graphical forms</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>But avoid visual clutter such as background graphics that do not add value</p>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Make the point clear</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask yourself &quot;what is the point I want to make in this slide?&quot; Once you have determined the point, ask yourself &quot;can I improve the slide to make the point clearer?&quot;</li>
            <li>Use <em>assertion-evidence</em> type slides rather that <em>topic-content</em> type where applicable.</li>
            <li>Ensure every technical term used is either known to the audience or you define it explicitly. If you are not sure if the audience know the definition, <em>slip in</em> the definition casually to your explanations.</li>
            <li>Demo/describe your solution early to avoid setting expectations too high. <span class="dimmed">If you spend a lot of time explaning the problem or criticising competing solutions, audience expectations of your own solution might climb too high.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Animate meaningfully</strong>: Use animations/transitions to enhance the meaning of your slide content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Use the Click-Look-Recall technique</strong> instead of using cue cards:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure that you know the sequence of your talking points in advance.</li>
            <li>Map each point to a click on your slide, which should add a visual cue onto the slide that reminds you of the point you are supposed to talk about.</li>
            <li>During delivery, look at the slide as you click, and use the visual cue to recall the point.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </panel>
    <panel header="%%For reference: Tips from round A%%" no-close="">
      <div>
        <p>Try to follow these steps in this sequence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Define the <em>intended impact</em> of the talk.</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try to choose an impact that has a <em>do</em> component (e.g., <code>get audience to switch to technology X</code>), not just <em>know</em> and <em>believe</em> components (e.g., <code>tell audience about X</code>). The <em>do</em> component
                will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.</li>
              <li>Frame the intended impact as a <em>call-to-action</em> (CtA).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Find a WIIFY</strong> i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this <em>specific</em> audience at a <em>concrete</em> level. For example, explaining <code>how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now</code>              is better than making a general claim that <code>Foo is a useful technology</code>. Sometimes realizing that ‚Äòthere is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now‚Äô can be a turn off.<br> If
              you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Choose some key points that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We look for <strong>points, not topics</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>how to use X</code> is a topic while <code>X is easy to use</code> is a point</span>.</li>
              <li>Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, you should be able to say &quot;<code>a</code>; <code>b</code>; <code>c</code>; <em>therefore</em>, <code>CtA</code>&quot;
                <span class="dimmed">e.g., &quot;<code>X is fast</code>; <code>X is free</code>; <code>X is getting popular</code>; <em>therefore</em>, switch to X!&quot;</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Decide the talk roadmap (aka agenda, or promise). The may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. Roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather than answers).</p>
            <table class="markbind-table table">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Roadmap</th>
                  <th>Key points</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>What is X</code><br> <code>Demo of X</code><br> <code>Benefits of X</code></td>
                  <td><code>X is fast</code><br> <code>X is free</code><br> <code>X is getting popular</code></td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Find a PUNCH.</strong> This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic <span class="dimmed">e.g, if your CtA is <code>switch to X</code>, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X</span>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Design the slide content.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br> Peers reviewing
                a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can spot those holes.</li>
              <li>Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
                <span class="dimmed">e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:</span>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><span class="dimmed">There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Ensure the last slide has the key points (not a big <code>Thank You</code> or <code>Q&amp;A</code>)</li>
              <li>Limit the content to what you can deliver in <strong>7 minutes</strong> (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&amp;A.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Start the talk with a <em>PUNCH</em>, <em>WIIFY</em>, and the <em>Roadmap</em></strong>. <mark>Avoid the traditional <code>My name is A, my topic is B</code> type start.</mark></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>End the talk with key points and CtA.</strong> It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance</strong>.</p>
