      <p>MON 1200-1400 in COM1-0210 (SR10)</p>
      <h2 id="external-project">External Project<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#external-project"></a></h2>
      <p><strong>Objective</strong> : To learn to work with big OSS projects.</p>
      <p>You can choose any OSS project as your External project, provided it is be a big mature external project with an established community and experienced developers.</p>
      <p>Some sources of potential external projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations/">GSoC projects</a> are a good place to start your search but note that not all GSoC projects qualify.</li>
        <li>Other lists of beginner-friendly OSS projects: <a href="http://up-for-grabs.net">up-for-grabs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners">awesome-for-beginners</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are not making good progress with the chosen project by week 5, you should switch to a different project.
        Or you can try multiple projects at the same time. &quot;The project was too slow to respond&quot; is not a valid excuse.
        The work under this part,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>is cumulative i.e. the work can be in more than one qualifying projects. Even work done before the semester can be counted.</li>
        <li>can be double-counted for expert area if the work is related to your expert area.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 - 3 PRs merged. Only merged PRs are counted.</li>
        <li>A one-page report (due by week 10) containing,
          <ul>
            <li>a comparison between the process of the external project to the <tooltip content="the project you worked in CS3282">internal project</tooltip>
            </li>
            <li>suggestions for the internal project based on what you observed in the external project</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Counts for 30% of the module</li>
        <li>Based on PRs completed [20%] and the report [10%]</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="expertise-areas">Expertise Areas<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#expertise-areas"></a></h2>
      <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Gain in-depth knowledge of a few specific areas so that you are considered an expert of those areas compared to your peers.</p>
      <p>Just one semester is certainly not enough to become an ‘expert’ of something. Consider this module just the initial step in the journey of becoming an expert. Our expectations are,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>By the end of the semester, you know your chosen expertise areas better than your peers to the extent that you can teach those peers interesting and useful things from those areas.</li>
        <li>Based on your current trajectory, assuming you continue to improve your knowledge in that area for 1-2 years after the module (for most of you this would coincide with your graduation), your knowledge in that area is among the top 5% of your cohort .</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="things-to-do">Things to do</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Your are recommended (but not required) to pick one from each of the three below. <strong>Up to three expert areas can earn credit.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Aspect</strong>: Various aspects of an SE project e.g. Testing, CI, Scalability, Requirements, Security, Performance, ...</li>
            <li><strong>Language</strong>: e.g. Java, C#, Go, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, Elixir, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ...</li>
            <li><strong>Topic</strong>: Any other technical topic relevant to SE that you want to claim as your interest/expert area e.g Search Engine Optimization, Regular Expressions</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>If you are not sure which ones to pick</strong>, <a href="expertAreas.html">this document</a> may be useful.</p>
          <p><strong>How many areas to pick?</strong> Consider the three categories as recommendations only. You can pick areas outside of those categories and you can pick multiple topics from the same category. The only restriction is that you can claim credit for no more than three expert areas. <span class="dimmed"> Rationale: to prevent folks from throwing in every area they know as expert areas.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Learn more about them yourself. While you do that, produce evidence of your knowledge. <span class="dimmed">E.g. blog posts, stackoverflow questions/answers</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Create learning resources for others trying to learn the same area (see <a href="#book-chapter">Book Chapter</a> deliverables explained below)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Share interesting and useful bits of your knowledge with the class by giving short talks (refer <a href="#lightning-talks">Lightning Talks</a> deliverables explained below)</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="deliverables-2">Deliverables</h3>
      <div id="deliverable-book-chapter">
        <h4 id="book-chapter">Book Chapter</h4>
        <p>We are going to build a <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources">collection of learning resources</a> (an online book of sorts) to help others learn the areas you are learning yourself.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are expected to make periodic PRs to create/enhance the relevant pages as you learn the topic. Minimally, you are expected to merge one PR by week 7 and one more by week 13.</li>
          <li>Do <mark>read the <a href="https://se-edu.github.io/learningresources/contributing.html">instructions on how to contribute to se-edu/learningresources</a></mark>.</li>
          <li>Improving existing content is as valuable as adding new content.</li>
          <li>While you have write access to the repo, use your own fork to submit PRs.</li>
          <li>You can create PRs without corresponding issues.</li>
          <li>Please get the PRs reviewed and approved by a peer before requesting prof's review. You can also request reviews from past contributors of the repo (especially if you are improving an existing topic) but there is no guarantee that they will be available to review.</li>
          <li>When getting reviews, it is useful to get a review from somebody how knows the topic (to help with the accuracy of the content) but also from somebody who is new to the topic (i.e., your target reader).</li>
          <li>Aim to get some content merged before mid-semester break.</li>
          <li>If there are others in the class working on the same topic, coordinate among yourselves to avoid duplication of work.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4 id="lightning-talks">Lightning talks</h4>
      <p>One important way you can establish credibility as an 'Expert' is by educating others about your expert area and evangelizing it. <em>Lightning Talks</em> is meant to promote that aspect.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each student is required to give two short talks on interesting topics useful to your classmates.
          <ul>
            <li>There are three rounds of lightning talks: Round A, B, and C. However, Round B is a rehearsal for Round C i.e., only two talks, but the second one is given twice.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each talk will be about 7 minutes + 3 minutes for Q&amp;A. There will be 7-8 talks per week.</li>
        <li>You may want to rehearse the talk with one or more of your team members and improve based on their feedback before delivering it to the class.</li>
        <li>After the talk, you are required to post the talk summary (and the slides) as an issue in the nus-cs3281/2019 repo for future reference and further discussion.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>You’ll work in small team (4-5 members). Team members are expected to peer-review work of each other.</li>
        <li>Teams will be formed by the instructor. The teams may be changed at the middle of the semester.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>

        <li>Start looking for an external OSS project. Once you have found a few potential projects, try to get started on contributing to them.
