  * :alarm_clock: By the end of Monday, post an issue in repo [nus-cs3281/2018](https://github.com/nus-cs3281/2018) as follows %%&nbsp;Reason: posting titles in advance will help us avoid topic duplications%%:
    * Issue subject: the title of your talk
    * Issue body: 2-3 sentence preview of the talk
  * Check to see if there are duplicate topics already posted. You are discouraged from (but not prevented from) choosing a topic already chosen by another.
  * It is in your interest to choose a topic related to one of your expert areas. It is not a strict requirement though.
* The order of talks %%&nbsp;(i.e., who presents in which week)%% will be announced by Monday night.
* Read the schedule for [next Monday](#week3-monday) to find more info about the upcoming lightning talks.

#### Thursday

* :loudspeaker: Lecture: Project-specific discussions

* If you are presenting next Monday,
  * You can rehearse your talk with a peer and get his/her feedback, but do this _after_ the session.
  * If you plan to use your own laptop for the presentation, you can test your connection to the projector during the session.

## Week 3 [Jan 29]

#### Monday

* :loudspeaker: Lecture: Lightning Talks Round A - Part 1
  * Speaker order: chosen based on the alphabetical order of last three letters of the full name (as per IVLE), limited to 1-2 students from each team per week.  
    * Week 3: Daniel, Joanne, Vivek, Bao, Dat, Li Hao, Jun Kiat
    * Week 4: Darren, Yan Hwa, Rachael, Shradheya, Jun An, Lechuan, Zhi Yuan
    * Week 5: Nicholas, Chun Rong, Cara, Alex, Lewis, Wen Xin, Haozhe

<panel header="Some things to consider when preparing for the talk" expanded no-close>

<span id="tips-roundA">

Try to follow these steps in this sequence:

  1. **Define the _intended impact_ of the talk.** 
     * Try to choose an impact that has a _do_ component (e.g., `get audience to switch to technology X`), not just _know_ and _believe_ components (e.g., `tell audience about X`). The _do_ component will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.
     * Frame the intended impact as a _call-to-action_ (CtA).
  1. **Find a WIIFY** i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this _specific_ audience at a _concrete_ level. 
     For example, explaining `how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now` is better than making a general claim that `Foo is a useful technology`. Sometimes realizing that ‘there is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now’ can be a turn off.<br>
     If you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.
  1. Choose some key points that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points. 
     * We look for **points, not topics** %%e.g., `how to use X` is a topic while `X is easy to use` is a point%%. 
     * Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are `a`, `b`, `c`, you should be able to say "`a`; `b`; `c`; _therefore_, `CtA`" %%e.g., "`X is fast`; `X is free`; `X is getting popular`; _therefore_, switch to X!"%%
  1. Decide the talk roadmap (aka agenda, or promise). The may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. Roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather than answers).
     Roadmap | Key points
     --- | ----
     `What is X`<br> `Demo of X`<br> `Benefits of X` | `X is fast`<br> `X is free`<br> `X is getting popular`
  1. **Find a PUNCH.** This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic %%e.g, if your CtA is `switch to X`, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X%%. 
  1. Design the slide content.
     * One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br>
       Peers reviewing a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can spot those holes.
     * Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
       %%e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:%% 
       >%%There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.%%
     * Ensure the last slide has the key points (not a big `Thank You` or `Q&A`)
     * Limit the content to what you can deliver in **7 minutes** (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&A.
  1. **Start the talk with a _PUNCH_, _WIIFY_, and the _Roadmap_**. ==Avoid the traditional `My name is A, my topic is B` type start.==
  1. **End the talk with key points and CtA.** It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points. 

  1. **Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance**.

#### Todo

* If you haven't started already, this is a good time to start getting ==at least one peer-review from classmates== before requesting reviews from a senior developer. 
  * You can request a review from a peer directly or you can post a 'call for reviewers' in the respective chat channels. 
  * You can get early inputs from senior devs if necessary, %%e.g., you are not sure about the overall direction of the PR, you want to know the rationale for the current code, etc.%%
* You can also ==help to manage new/external contributors== %%e.g., answer their questions, review their PRs etc.%% Even if their question is directed at a senior dev or the prof, you can jump in and answer if you know the answer.
