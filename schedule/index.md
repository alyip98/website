    * Issue subject: the title of your talk
    * Issue body: 2-3 sentence preview of the talk
  * Check to see if there are duplicate topics already posted. You are discouraged from (but not prevented from) choosing a topic already chosen by another.
  * It is in your interest to choose a topic related to one of your expert areas. It is not a strict requirement though.
* The order of talks %%&nbsp;(i.e., who presents in which week)%% will be announced by Monday night.
* Read the schedule for [next Monday](#week3-monday) to find more info about the upcoming lightning talks.

#### Thursday

* :loudspeaker: Lecture: Project-specific discussions

* If you are presenting next Monday,
  * You can rehearse your talk with a peer and get his/her feedback, but do this _after_ the session.
  * If you plan to use your own laptop for the presentation, you can test your connection to the projector during the session.

## Week 3 [Jan 29]

#### Monday

* :loudspeaker: Lecture: Lightning Talks Round A - Part 1

<panel header="Some things to consider when preparing for the talk" expanded no-close>

  1. Try to follow the tips discussed previous Monday: 
     1. In particular, remember to start the talk with a _PUNCH_, _WIIFY_, and the _Promise_.<br> 
     The WIIFY can work better if it relates to the audience at a concrete level. 
     For example, explaining ‘how Foo technology can benefit you right now’ is better than making a general claim that ‘Foo is a useful technology’. Sometimes realizing that ‘there is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now’ can be a turn off.<br>
       WIIFY can be revisited at the end of the talk too.
     1. Be clear about your key points. Remember, we look for points, top topics.
  1. One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br>
     Peers reviewing a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can spot those holes.
  1. Also show how the topic fits into the big picture. For example, let’s say your topic is a tool called X. 
     _The ‘big picture’ view can be something like this: 
     >There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.
  1. Please limit the length to **7 minutes**. The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&A.
  1. Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance. 
  
</panel>
<panel header="During the session" expanded no-close> 
  
  * No laptops allowed during talks (except the speaker).
  * Note down comments about the talk on paper (provided).

</panel>
<panel header="After the session" expanded no-close>
  
  * :alarm_clock: by Monday midnight:
    * Speakers should update the issue description (rather than add as a new comment) as follows:
      * Add a link to the slides. %%&nbsp;Note that GitHub allows attaching ppt files. Just drag-drop the files to the comment box.%%
      * State WIIFY, Key Points, Call to Action
  * :alarm_clock: by Tuesday midnight:
    * All must submit feedback to speakers (via TEAMMATES). The quality of feedback is considered in grading.
     
  * Feel free to continue the discussion about each talk in the issue tracker.

## Week 4 [Feb 5]

#### Todo

* :clipboard: If you haven't already, get started with contributing to the external project. If you don't make any progress by week 5, you need to find another project.
* :clipboard: Get started with adding content to the [learning resources repo](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources) (aka 'book chapter' deliverable).
  * While you have write access to the repo, use your own fork to submit PRs.
  * You can create PRs without corresponding issues.
  * Please get the PRs reviewed and approved by a peer before requesting prof's review.
  * Aim to get some content merged before mid-semester break.
  * If there are others in the class working on the same topic, coordinate among yourselves to avoid duplication of work.
  * Some things to keep in mind when writing the 'book chapter':
    * Despite using the name ‘book chapter’ for this deliverable (for the lack of a better term), 
      it is not a normal book. It’s more of an online repository of learning resources. 
      Therefore, don’t try to follow the structure of normal text books. 
    * Related to the above, there’s no need to use a very formal tone that you see in some text books. 
      Instead, prefer an informal tone you would use in a blog post or an stackoverflow question.
    * The book is aimed at typical SE students, but not necessarily SE students in our school. 
    * Don’t assume the reader has any prior knowledge of the topic. Just because it is covered in a core module in our school does not mean it will be known to every reader.
    * Try to include content that is highly useful and relevant to the reader. The objective is to help the reader, not to demonstrate your expertise. The latter is only a by-product of the former.
    * Do not re-invent the wheel by writing a lot of original content. 
      Instead, give a brief high-level view and point to other existing resources that you recommend the reader to use. The value you add is in the form of assembling **a curated list of the best resources into a meaningful sequence, possibly with commentary**, NOT creating new content.
